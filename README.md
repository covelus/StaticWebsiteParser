# StaticWebsiteParser
Imagine you want to expose (for personal and private purposes) a REST API, providing JSON information taken from a Website that doesn't provide a Webservice... 
This is just an example for fun of an specific-HTML-page-dependent static Website parser (you must modify it for each different HTML).
